# 🐢 Turtle Graphics Patterns 🎨

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that generate various graphical patterns and designs using the `turtle` module. Each script creates a unique and visually appealing pattern, ranging from Fibonacci spirals to colorful circles and star patterns. 🌀✨

## Scripts 📜

1. **Fibonacci Spiral Fractal Plot** 🌀

   - `fibonacci.py`
   - Generates a Fibonacci spiral fractal plot by drawing connected squares with side lengths corresponding to the Fibonacci sequence.
   - The user is prompted to enter the number of iterations, which determines the complexity of the fractal. 🔢

2. **Spiral Helix** 🌈

   - `SpiralHelixPattern.py`
   - Creates a colorful spiral pattern by iteratively changing the pen color and width while moving the turtle forward and turning. 🌀

3. **Benzene Pattern** 🎨

   - `rainbowBenzene.py`
   - Generates a pattern of overlapping Benzene with random colors. 🔴🟢🔵
   - The script iterates 100 times, creating a Benzene structure with a random RGB color and a varying radius on each iteration. 💯

4. **Spiral Star Pattern** ⭐

   - `spiralStarPattern.py`
   - Draws a spiral pattern of stars with random colors. 🌟
   - The user can customize the number of stars, the exterior angle of each star, and the angle of rotation for the spiral. 🔧
